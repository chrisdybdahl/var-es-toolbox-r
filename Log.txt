10.12.24

CAViaR fixed argument control and diagnostics
CAViaR added 1e-7 as convergence rate for both optim and solnp
CAViaR if model not converges, use parameters from last refitting

09.12.24_latest

Many fail for Q and Y contracts, specifically for GARCH types and using std
All GARCH types have tol = 1e-7
EVT-GARCH has very many violations
CAViaR models create some negative values (all except indirectGARCH)
Standardized tests not used, since VOL not saved
DQ test always rejected
Does CAViaR have more relaxed optimizing criteria, and maybe hard to converge when NA values?
MCS not working
Check if lags are correct

DONE:
EVT-GARCH fix - Changed gpd from evir to extreme
EVT-GARCH threshold changed from 95% to 90%
CAViaR Set NA in loss to be 5 * max loss
CAViaR set parameter bound, and increased grid to 10000 from 1000
CAViaR added Rsolnp optimization as roll back for optim
EVT-GARCH changed lags and added reparam of GARCH, and fallback to GARCH



09.12.24

All GARCH types have tol = 1e-7
gjrGARCH fails often
EVT-GARCH has very many violations
CAViaR models create some negative values (all except indirectGARCH)
Standardized tests not used, since VOL not saved
DQ test always rejected
Does CAViaR have more relaxed optimizing criteria, and maybe hard to converge when NA values?
MCS not working
How many decimals?
Check if lags are correct

DONE:
EVT-GARCH fix - Changed gpd from evir to extreme
EVT-GARCH threshold changed from 95% to 90%
Set NA in loss to 1e+10, which is a consequence of negative values
