All GARCH types have tol = 1e-7
gjrGARCH fails often
EVT-GARCH creates some negative values
- Can remove min exceedances

eGARCH get very large sometimes
CAViaR models create some negative values
Standardized tests not used, since VOL not saved
DQ test always rejected
Does CAViaR have more relaxed optimizing criteria?
MCS not working

DONE:
EVT-GARCH fix - Changed gpd from evir to extreme
EVTshre
